# Variadic Functions Mastery Challenge

## Overview

Welcome to my Variadic Functions Mastery Challenge repository! This is where I document my week-long journey to master the concept of variadic functions in C. 
Each day, I'll be exploring different aspects of variadic functions, working on projects, and sharing my progress on Twitter.
This is part of a discipline game aimed to ensure the maintenance of discipline and to hold myself accountable together with others who will be part of this 30 day jo
urney.

In preparation of what I am to do this week I have done a breakdown on what to to do each day of the week

## Day 1: Introduction and Basics 
(04/01/2024)

- Completed reading on C functions basics.
- Experimented with basic function syntax.
- Started understanding `stdarg.h` and its macros.

## Day 2: Variadic Functions Practice
- Mastered variadic function syntax.
- Wrote simple variadic functions.
- Practiced using different data types in variadic functions.

* got a sample problem from hackerrank to help in my practice [hackerrank problem](practice_file_1.c)

use this to compile your code
`gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic practice_file_1.c main.c -o 1-practice`

## Involving GitHub

I'm using GitHub to log my daily progress, share code snippets, and engage with the community.
Commits are made for each learning session. Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback!

## Twitter Updates

Follow my journey on Twitter(X) [@grey_jacki3](https://x.com/grey_jacki3?t=ERZ2TKae4lhBI_4l8c8b5Q&s=09) and join the conversation using the hashtag #CProgramming #VariadicFunctions.

Let's master variadic functions together! ðŸš€
